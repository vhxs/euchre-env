## Euchre game environment
Euchre is a popular trick-taking card game played a lot in the midwest. I play it with family all the time. Euchre has a small (but still big) state space as far as card games go (24 cards, 4 players, 5 tricks per round).

Let's get the game written first, and maybe put a front end on it, then maybe do AI something or other with it?

*The American Hoyle; or, Gentleman's hand-book of games* on Library of Congress, apparently considered the holy grail of Euchre strategy: [link](https://www.loc.gov/resource/dcmsiabooks.americanhoyleorg00dick_0/?sp=2&st=pdf&pdfPage=1). The guy named Hoyle predates the existence of Euchre though.

Someone made a JavaScript library to render cards (though it looks like it may not be maintained anymore): https://github.com/richardschneider/cardsJS
